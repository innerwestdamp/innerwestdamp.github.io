				<em>"Rodney and his team are without doubt some of the best trades people I have dealt with ever. I can without hesitation strongly recommend Inner West Damp for your damp works. Quick response to come inspect, quote and then attend to the works. Very helpful and patient in answering questions, obviously knowledgeable about what needed to be done (ie sold us what we needed, and very sensibly priced, not just the product they sold as others attempted to do). <br><br>Brilliant on the execution - works done to spec and very neatly, tidied up afterwards, on time. Brilliant on the follow up. The works were done a couple of months ago - our damp problem has been completely fixed. This is an independent review, which I chose to do given the top quality service and works. It is hard to find good people other than by referral - happy to refer Inner West Damp."</em>

				<em>"Having just bought an old terrace in Balmain, one of the very first things we wanted to do was to make the house feel clean and healthy by addressing what looked to be a pretty serious damp problem. It was really important to me to resolve the issue without using harmful chemicals, so Inner West Damp was one of the companies we asked to take a look at the house and provide us with a quote.<br><br>
					We found Rod Wilson to be practical, knowledgeable, reliable and easy going. Unlike the other companies we had quote this job, Rod told us that we actually didn’t have a huge problem with damp. Not only did he go about fixing the problem promptly so we could get on with painting etc, he listened to our various concerns and helped us out with useful information about other aspects of caring for the house and bringing it back to its former glory. He was also extremely cost efficient compared to the competition – at literally a fraction of the price."</em>

				<em>"I cannot recommend Inner West Damp high enough. Rodney is probably the most genuine, polite, efficient, trustworthy tradesman around. His work is impeccable and even cleans up after himself like he has not even been there. The quality of his work is second to none and very honest when comes to price and advice. I would not hesitate recommending Rod for your sub floor ventilation system. THANK YOU!!"</em>

				<em>"We had a problem with mould growing in one room of our older house in Ryde. Rodney came over and identified the source of the issue in the sub-floor, provided us with an honest assessment and a cost effective solution. We couldn't be happier with his work. I'd definitely recommend his services if you have a problem with rising damp."</em>

				<em>"I had Rodney and his nephew over today to install wire mesh air vents around our house. Rodney has been a pleasure to work with throughout the whole process. Great communicator, arrives on time, works quickly and did a fantastic job. His advice on damp problems and recommending solutions is truly exceptional. His reasonable pricing is just an added bonus. Don't go to a company that'll just sell you the biggest mechanical ventilation system they have - go to Rodney and get quality unbiased advice on the exact cause of damp and the best solution. I cannot recommend Rodney enough and he will be the first person I call next time if I ever have another damp problem."</em>

				<em>"After years of making my home mould and dustmite free, I couldn’t understand why I kept having sinus and breathing problems. I made a call to have the house checked for mould and dampness. It appeared that stagnant air was trapped under the house because my ventilation  did not go through the double brick. This was also verified by my engineer friend who recommended putting more vents in sub-floor.<br><br>Rod Wilson came out and installed 13 new vents and drilled through the double brickwork. He also opened air channels in sub floor walls between areas. Within a week, my sinuses improved and I wasn’t waking up full of phlegm. I’d also like to note what a friendly and diligent man Rod was. He knows his business and does go the extra mile to do the job in a clean and efficient manner. I highly recommend his company to correct your damp and mould concerns."</em>
