				<em>"Rodney and his team are without doubt some of the best trades people I have dealt with ever. I can without hesitation strongly recommend Inner West Damp for your damp works. Quick response to come inspect, quote and then attend to the works. Very helpful and patient in answering questions, obviously knowledgeable about what needed to be done (ie sold us what we needed, and very sensibly priced, not just the product they sold as others attempted to do). <br><br>Brilliant on the execution - works done to spec and very neatly, tidied up afterwards, on time. Brilliant on the follow up. The works were done a couple of months ago - our damp problem has been completely fixed. This is an independent review, which I chose to do given the top quality service and works. It is hard to find good people other than by referral - happy to refer Inner West Damp."</em>

				<em>"Having just bought an old terrace in Balmain, one of the very first things we wanted to do was to make the house feel clean and healthy by addressing what looked to be a pretty serious damp problem. It was really important to me to resolve the issue without using harmful chemicals, so Inner West Damp was one of the companies we asked to take a look at the house and provide us with a quote.<br><br>
					We found Rod Wilson to be practical, knowledgeable, reliable and easy going. Unlike the other companies we had quote this job, Rod told us that we actually didn’t have a huge problem with damp. Not only did he go about fixing the problem promptly so we could get on with painting etc, he listened to our various concerns and helped us out with useful information about other aspects of caring for the house and bringing it back to its former glory. He was also extremely cost efficient compared to the competition – at literally a fraction of the price."</em>

His work is impeccable and even cleans up after himself like he has not even been there. The quality of his work is second to none and very honest when comes to price and advice. I would not hesitate recommending Rod for your sub floor ventilation system. THANK YOU!!"</em>

				<em>"I had Rodney and his nephew over today to install wire mesh air vents around our house. Rodney has been a pleasure to work with throughout the whole process. Great communicator, arrives on time, works quickly and did a fantastic job. His advice on damp problems and recommending solutions is truly exceptional. His reasonable pricing is just an added bonus. Don't go to a company that'll just sell you the biggest mechanical ventilation system they have - go to Rodney and get quality unbiased advice on the exact cause of damp and the best solution. I cannot recommend Rodney enough and he will be the first person I call next time if I ever have another damp problem."</em>

				<em>"After years of making my home mould and dustmite free, I couldn’t understand why I kept having sinus and breathing problems. I made a call to have the house checked for mould and dampness. It appeared that stagnant air was trapped under the house because my ventilation  did not go through the double brick. This was also verified by my engineer friend who recommended putting more vents in sub-floor.<br><br>Rod Wilson came out and installed 13 new vents and drilled through the double brickwork. He also opened air channels in sub floor walls between areas. Within a week, my sinuses improved and I wasn’t waking up full of phlegm. I’d also like to note what a friendly and diligent man Rod was. He knows his business and does go the extra mile to do the job in a clean and efficient manner. I highly recommend his company to correct your damp and mould concerns."</em>

				<em>"Cannot recommend Rodney and his team highly enough.<br>
I had a number of companies come and quote to ventilate our sub floor. All of the others, in my view, were poor communicators and were not particularly responsive.
Rodney, on the other hand, was very responsive and knowledgeable. Answered all of my questions and is clearly an expert in his field.
His team did a marvelous job installing our system and very neatly installed two additional sub floor vents.
A quality job at a reasonable price.<br>
Make sure you get a quote from Rodney BEFORE you decide to use anyone else!!!!"</em>

				<em>"Nothing but Praises!<br><br>Rodney Wilson and his team have done a fantastic job to the rising damp, covering a bed room and the hallway through to dining room at my house in Stanmore. They are responsive, punctual, friendly, polite, attention to details, well price, knowledgeable and trustworthy. They listened to my concerns, explained and recommended the solution. Mervyn has done a great job on rerendering and plastering. Thank you to Martin on trying hard to source the new skirting board to match with the rest of the house. Everything was delivered as expected. They make sure I’m happy with the final product and are happy to provide advices after the job is completed. Thank you so much to Rodney and the team for delivering an amazing end to end customer service to such a major house work. I highly recommend Rodney and his team if you are looking for a trustworthy, honest tradesmen at competitive price for their excellent delivery."</em>

				<em>"Rodney and Inner West were recommended to us by neighbours. He came out to look at our house which has had mould. Part of the issue was that previous owners built up a walkway above the subfloor vents. Instead of an expensive excavation project, Rodney came up with a common sense solution to raise the vents on the outside (double brick wall) and increasing the existing hole size on the inner brick wall. He also added several fans to increase the airflow. Inner West took care of every aspect of the job including hiring a certified electrician and cleaning up not only their workspace but our fallen leaves. Rodney and Lachie were meticulous in finishing the vents and ensuring previous work looked consistent with the new vents."</em>

				<em>"Really appreciated the high quality job Rod did for us a few years ago. He was very honest and provided very clear, helpful and practical advice regarding damp in our home. We had been quoted extraordinary amounts to do significant work to our home, which wasn't necessary. We didn't know what advice to trust, but Rod came across as very trustworthy and he advised installing subfloor ventilation, which was a much more cost effective solution and did the job well. We recently asked him to do an assessment and quote for damp in our new home, and again, Rod was honest and reliable. Rather than encourage us to do unnecessary work at great expense (and to provide himself with business), he provided honest advice regarding re-painting the exterior of the house as the main prevention for any damp in our home. I highly recommend Rod."</em>

			<em>"We have been putting off addressing a damp problem in our house for years, and having seen the team at Inner West Damp at work, we regret not calling them sooner. Over the years the subfloor on our 1930s bungalow in Five Dock had been encased with bricks and render providing no opportunity for the sub-floor to breathe. They installed a number of grates around the house which now allow ventilation to flow through the sub floor. We feared this might have been an expensive, messy and drawn out process. But it was none of those. The team turned up promptly and had the entire works (opening up the subfloor and installing 8 grates) completed within 5 hours. The job was immaculate. The rubble was cleared and taken away and the new grates look like they’ve always been there. We really appreciate the attention to detail / taking the time to level out the render surrounding the grates. And all for a fraction of the cost we were expecting. We would have no hesitation in recommending Inner West Damp to anyone with similar issues."</em>
