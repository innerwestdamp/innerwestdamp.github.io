            <h1>Why Choose Us?</h1><br>
            <p><strong>We specialise in rising damp and sub-floor ventilation.</strong></p>
            <p>Inner West Damp is based in Sydney's Inner West and services all surrounding areas including Ryde, Balmain, Annandale, Glebe and beyond.</p>
            <p>Rodney Wilson is the brains behind the business and has been working in the industry since 1978.  Starting with rising damp in remedial building works in the UK, he has since migrated to Australia and completed his trade in carpentry while continuing his work with damp and sub-floor ventilation.</p>  
            <p><strong>Rodney's knowledge of building structure is invaluable when diagnosing problems associated with dampness.  This experience combined with his keen insight makes him one of the leading tradespeople in the industry.</strong> </p>
            <p>Rodney is friendly, neat and professional and if you ask him nicely enough, he'll pass on his tips for his famous chocolate brownies.
